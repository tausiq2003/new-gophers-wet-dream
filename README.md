### This is a website made while I am learning Golang, for latest updates see latest commit.

- I am doing it in React.
- I am doing it in Golang(why not)?
- I am doing it using docker postgres.


- As of 20/05/2025, I am learning golang, will push constantly.



P.S. We are building a twitter like application or whatever it is, where: 
- users can write text, edit text, post it, delete it.
- you can read others post, thats it, lets implement this first, then we will look


### Installation


- For frontend 
```npm install && npm run dev```
- For backend, i guess
```go mod tidy && go run backend```

Will update this very very soon. Let me do my cum exercise.
